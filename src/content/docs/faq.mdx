## What is Invio?
A self-hosted invoicing app. It’s fast, minimal, and transparent—you own your data.

## How do I install it?
Follow Guides → Quick Start to run it with Docker Compose. You’ll be up in minutes.

## Can I use my own invoice design?
Yes. Create a single HTML file, install it via a manifest from Settings → Templates, and set it as the default. See Guides → Create a Template.

## Why can’t I add images or external fonts to templates?
For security and reliability. Installed templates are sanitized and limited. Keep CSS inline and simple for the most reliable PDFs.

## My PDF looks different from the HTML. What can I do?
Simplify your CSS (tables and basic layout work best) and avoid advanced features. wkhtmltopdf is conservative.

## Where is my data stored?
Everything lives in a SQLite database file on disk. Template files from manifests are mirrored under `backend/data/templates/`.

## How do public invoice links work?
Publish an invoice to generate a share token. Anyone with the link can view HTML or download the PDF.

## Is there an API?
Yes. See Reference → API for endpoints to manage invoices, customers, templates, and settings.

## How do I back up and restore?
Stop the app and copy the SQLite DB file (and `backend/data/templates/` if you use manifest-installed templates). To restore, replace the files and start the app.

## How do I secure my instance?
Use strong `ADMIN_USER`/`ADMIN_PASS`, keep `.env` private, restrict exposed ports, and back up regularly.
