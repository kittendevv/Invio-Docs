import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This page shows a simple, reliable way to run Invio in production with Docker Compose. Copy the snippet, set your env, and you’re good to go.

## Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Backend image with Deno 2.x and wkhtmltopdf installed

## Environment

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ADMIN_USER` | Admin username for Basic Auth. |
| `ADMIN_PASS` | Admin password for Basic Auth. |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret used for optional JWT issuance. |
| `DATABASE_PATH` | SQLite path inside the container (e.g., `/app/data/invio.db`). |
| `BACKEND_URL` | Frontend→Backend base URL (e.g., `http://backend:3000`). |

## Compose tips

- Keep the backend service name as `backend` (or update `BACKEND_URL`).
- Expose backend on port 3000 and frontend (Fresh) on 8000.
- Mount volumes for the SQLite DB and `backend/data/templates`.
- Add a simple healthcheck hitting `/health`.

### Example snippet

```yaml
services:
	backend:
		image: your/deno-backend:latest # includes wkhtmltopdf
		env_file: .env
		ports: ["3000:3000"]
		healthcheck:
			test: ["CMD", "curl", "-fsS", "http://localhost:3000/health"]
			interval: 30s
			timeout: 5s
			retries: 3
		volumes:
			- invio_data:/app/data
			- invio_templates:/app/backend/data/templates

	frontend:
		image: your/fresh-frontend:latest
		env_file: .env
		ports: ["8000:8000"]
		depends_on: [backend]

volumes:
	invio_data: {}
	invio_templates: {}
```

## Persistence

- Persist the SQLite database at `DATABASE_PATH`
- Persist template assets at `backend/data/templates`

## Security

- Use strong `ADMIN_USER`/`ADMIN_PASS` values; keep `.env` private.
- If frontend and backend run separately, expose only what’s needed.
- Enable automated backups of volumes.

## Post-deploy checks

- Open `/health` on the backend and confirm `{ status: "ok" }`.
- Log in to the frontend and create a test invoice.
- Download a PDF to verify `wkhtmltopdf` is available.
