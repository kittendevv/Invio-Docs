Spin up Invio locally in a few minutes. You'll log in, create a customer, make an invoice, and download a PDF.

<Steps>

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kittendevv/Invio.git
   cd Invio
   ```

2. Copy and configure environment

   Copy the example file and edit values as needed:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # then open .env and set ADMIN_USER, ADMIN_PASS, JWT_SECRET, DATABASE_PATH, BACKEND_URL
   ```

3. Start the stack

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. Log in

   Visit `http://localhost:8000` and log in with your `ADMIN_USER`/`ADMIN_PASS`.

5. Next steps

   - Create a customer, then an invoice.
   - Publish the invoice and open the public HTML/PDF link.
   - Tweak your business settings and choose a default template.

</Steps>

### Troubleshooting

- PDFs not generating? Make sure the backend image includes `wkhtmltopdf`, or use the HTML view as a fallback.
- Seeing 401 Unauthorized? Check `.env` `ADMIN_USER`/`ADMIN_PASS`, then restart Compose.
- Frontend canâ€™t reach backend? Confirm `BACKEND_URL` in `.env` (e.g., `http://backend:3000`).
