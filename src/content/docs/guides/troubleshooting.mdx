## Login or 401 errors

- Check `.env` `ADMIN_USER` and `ADMIN_PASS`.
- Clear the `invio_auth` cookie and log in again.
- Ensure the frontend points to the correct `BACKEND_URL`.

## PDFs won’t generate

- Confirm the backend image includes `wkhtmltopdf`.
- Try the HTML view to verify rendering.
- Simplify CSS (tables/basic layout) to reduce HTML→PDF differences.

## Frontend can’t reach backend

- Verify `BACKEND_URL` (e.g., `http://backend:3000`).
- If running locally, make sure ports are published and services are up.

## Database or file permission errors

- Ensure the process can write to `DATABASE_PATH` and templates directory.
- In containers, check volume mounts and ownership.

## Template install fails

- The sanitizer blocks images, scripts, iframes, external CSS, and large files (>128KB).
- Keep HTML self-contained with inline `<style>`.
