<Steps>

1. Dashboard

   See totals, counts, and recent invoices. Use it as a quick health check.

2. Invoices

   List, search, and filter. Create new invoices. Open any invoice to edit, publish, mark sent/paid, duplicate, or delete.

3. Customers

   Manage customers. Creating a customer requires a name. Deletion is blocked when invoices exist.

4. Settings

   Configure business details, logo, highlight color, payment notes, and default template. Manage templates here.

5. Public Links

   Publish an invoice to generate a shareable link for HTML/PDF.
