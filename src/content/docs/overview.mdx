import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Welcome to Invio. It’s a fast, self‑hosted invoicing app you can run anywhere and actually understand. This page gives you the big picture and quick links to dive in.

## What is Invio?

Invio is a self-hosted invoicing app: fast, minimal, and transparent. You own your data and deploy it anywhere.

### Stack

- Backend: Deno 2.x, Hono, SQLite, wkhtmltopdf for PDFs
- Frontend: Fresh (Preact)
- Auth: Basic Auth for admin endpoints; optional JWT issuance (unused by current UI)
- Data: Customers, Invoices, Settings, Templates (HTML-based invoice themes)

### Key behaviors

- Invoice HTML rendered from selected template and business settings
- PDF generation via wkhtmltopdf with HTML fallback
- Built-in templates: professional-modern, minimalist-clean (not deletable)
- Public/private HTML and PDF share the same rendering pipeline

### What you’ll do here

- Log in and create your first customer and invoice
- Pick a default theme or install your own template
- Share a public link and download a PDF
